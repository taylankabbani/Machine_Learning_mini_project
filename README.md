# Machine_Learning_mini_project
Mini-projects in machine learning using Scikit learn in python 

Mini projects of regression, image classification and Grid Search in machine learning.
* running exploratory analysis on a dataset to better understand it and its features.
* preparing the data to apply the machine learning algorithms.
* Apply different machine learning algorithms.

## Regression mini-project ##
* The data set in this project contains information on many different car types and their prices.
* In this project  different ML regression modles will be build to predict car price.
* Steps of this project:
  1. DATA PREPARATION:
     1. Handling missing values
     2. One-hot encoding
     3. Standard scaling
  2. DATA EXPLORATION:
     1. Visualize variable distributions
     2. Calculate correlation
     3. Scatter plot
  3. LINEAR REGRESSION TO PREDICT CAR PRICES:
     1. Simple Linear Regression
     2. Polynomial Regression
     3. Lasso Regularization
     4. SVM (Grid Search)
     
 ## Image classification ##
 * The data set provided in this project contains pixel information of many 28x28 grayscale images of clothing, each image is labelled as one of the 10 different pieces of clothing(T-shirt/top, Trouser, Pullover, Dress, Coat, Sandal, Shirt, Sneaker, Bag, Ankle-boot)
 * Steps of this project:
   1. DATA PREPARATION & VISUALIZATION
   2. BINARY CLASSIFICATION:
      1. Logistic Regression
      2. Accuracy, confusion matrix, precision, recall and f1 score.
      3. ROC curve, AUC and learning curves.
   3. MULTICLASS CLASSIFICATION USING LOGISTIC REGRESSION
## Gride Seacrch ##
* The data set is the same one used in Regression mini-project
* Steps of this project:
  1. KNN REGRESSOR
  2. DECISION TREE REGRESSOR
  3. ENSEMBLE BAGGING REGRESSOR
  4. RANDOM FOREST REGRESSOR
